The Makefile in this directory supports a number of targets for
building components (or all) of the InfoSecBSD source tree, the most
commonly used one being ``world'', which rebuilds and installs
everything in the InfoSecBSD system from the source tree except the
kernel, the kernel-modules and the contents of /etc.  The ``world''
target should only be used in cases where the source tree has not
changed from the currently running version.
